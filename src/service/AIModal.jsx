Walking is also a good option, but be prepared for long distances. Ride-sharing services (Uber/Lyft) are convenient but can be more expensive during peak hours.\n* **Food:**  Eating on a budget in Vegas requires planning. Look for fast-food restaurants, food courts, happy hour specials, and grocery stores for snacks and drinks.\n* **Flexibility:** This is just a suggestion. Feel free to adjust the itinerary based on your interests and preferences.\n* **Booking:** Book your hotel in advance, especially if you're traveling during peak season.  Check for deals and discounts online.\n\nThis JSON provides a solid foundation for planning your trip. Remember to customize it to your specific interests and budget. Good luck and have a great time in Vegas!\n"},
